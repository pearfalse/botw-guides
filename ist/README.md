# IST - Inventory Slot Transfer

IST allows you to transfer inventory slots from one save file to another, by tricking the game into thinking it's cleared the inventory out when it hasn't. This lets you do fun stuff such as:

- [keeping the Bow of Light](Keeping%20the%20Bow%20of%20Light.md) outside the Dark Beast Ganon fight, without the huge swathes of event flags that mess with the rest of the game loop, or the hassle of Memory Storage;
- keeping the One Hit Obliterator outside its intended use in the Champion's Ballad quest (albeit with some caveats);
- skipping the Great Plateau by transferring in a paraglider from another save file that already has it.

Not only that, but because transferring slots like this bypasses many of the inventory's consistency checks, you can also:

- corrupt quantities of any stackable item up to 999 (and with arrows, you can go even higher);
- transfer durability between equipment of *any* kind;
- cook impossible meals;
- [add custom modifiers](../wmc/README.md) to equipment;
- get rid of **any** slot by [eating it](../pe/README.md).


This glitch works on the latest versions of both Switch (1.6.0) and Wii U (1.5.0) ports of the game, and in both Normal and Master Mode (although some IST setups require Normal Mode).

## Caution

IST is a complex glitch to execute. Understanding the basics of how it works and how to set it up is simple enough, but when you start applying it to your own inventory, things get _weird_. IST dredges up odd behaviors and edge cases in the inventory that even the most seasoned player would never run into in a glitchless file, and reloading an earlier save is no longer a neutral act.

If you get very unlucky, you can really mess up your save file inventory in ways that will affect your ability to play the game. Nothing is permanent, everything can be undone, but fixing it will probably need the more advanced uses of IST, like [prompt entanglement](../pe/README.md). If in doubt, stick to autosaves, or use an alternate profile entirely.

Don't let this discourage you, though; IST is an incredible glitch that can bend the game in all sorts of fascinating ways. It really puts the 'wild' back into 'breath of the wild'.
